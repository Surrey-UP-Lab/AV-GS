**This repository is the official implementation of "AV-GS: Learning Material and Geometry Aware Priors for Novel View Acoustic Synthesis".** In this paper, we propose a material-aware and geometry-aware condition for binaural audio synthesis, by learning an explicit point-based 3D audio-visual scene representation with an audio-guidance parameter on locally initialized Gaussian points, taking into account the space relation from the listener and sound source.
